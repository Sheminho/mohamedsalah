**HTML:**<br />
Our website comes in the main structure. It consists of two main sections, for which we used the tag `<div>`, and the first section is the navigation bar, then the second section, which is the body of our site.<br />
Then we come to the body, which is divided into 3 sections. We used the tag `<table>`, so that we can divide the site into two parts in the main interface. The left part contains data and the right part contains the Sidebar widget. As for the third section, it is at the bottom of the page that contains rights Copyright and language change button
After we finished creating the main structure of the site, we only had to fill it with the necessary data, put some appropriate images, and use `<b>`, `<i>`, and `<u>` for the appropriate text, then move on to the right side of the page.<br />
It is also a box that is a group of sections, and in the first section we put the search box through the tag `<input>` and next to it we put the search button through the tag `<button>` Then we moved to the next section, which contains the clubs that the player moved to, and we linked each club page with his name Using the tag `<anchor>` and also the `<ul>` to make a list of clubs, then we moved to the next section that contains a video of the player in which we used the tag `<video>` then we moved to the next section that contains a picture of the player and added it via the tag `<image>`.<br /><br />

**CSS:**<br />
We used CSS to organize (all fonts, their colors, sections, tables, and background colors) through the size-font, family-font, background-color, color attributes also (margin, padding) attributes to change the spacing between the elements and some of them. We also used The attribute border creates a frame around each section.<br /><br />

**Java script:**<br />
We used Java script to alert the user on the home page that he can change the language from the bottom of the page through the alert. We also used the event onclick to create another alert for the user when clicking on the search button to alert him that this site does not have a search because it is not an end-back website.
